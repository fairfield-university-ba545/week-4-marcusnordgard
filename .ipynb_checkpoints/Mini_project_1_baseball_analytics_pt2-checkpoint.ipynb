Sometimes we also using binning for __dimensionality reduction__ purposes. For instance, the feature year (`df['yearID']`) has more than 100 distinct values, so its dimensionality will be 100+. A lot of machine learning algorithms do not like high-dimensional features, so it is a common practice to __bin high-dimensional features__.\n",
